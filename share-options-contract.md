1. If at any time the Option Holder ceases to be an employee of the Company or any of
   its subsidiaries for any reason prior to the exercise of the Option, the

2. The Option Holder hereby agrees that he shall pay any Relevant Tax Liabilities. It is a condition of the exercise of the Option that, if required by the Board, the Option Holder enters into an election pursuant to paragraph 3B of Schedule 1 to the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 or such other agreement as may be necessary to ensure such liability is properly transferred.

    1. Compute the number of Shares that need to be sold to satisfy the Relevant Tax Liabilities, and 
    2. withhold that number of Shares from the allotment of Shares which would otherwise be made to the Option Holder, and 
    3. sell the withheld Shares as agent for the Option Holder at the best price which can reasonably be obtained at the time of sale, and 
    4. retain out of the net proceeds of sale of the withheld Shares (after deduction of all fees, commissions and expenses incurred in relation to such sale) monies sufficient to satisfy the Relevant Tax Liabilities.

## 7. Sale
   
1. The Company undertakes that, in the event of a Sale during the Option Exercise Period it will use all reasonable endeavours to procure that the Option Holder shall have an adequate opportunity to exercise the Option before the Sale is completed.

2. If a Sale is completed before the exercise of the Option then unless the Parties shall agree otherwise the Option will lapse and the Option Holder shall have no further right in respect of the Option Shares.

3. In the event of a Sale and provided the Option has not lapsed, the unvested Option Shares shall be handled as follows:
    - 50% shall become Vested Option Shares.
    - 50% shall become Delayed Vesting Option Shares.
    
4. The Option Holder undertakes that if they sell any Delayed Vesting Option Shares, then the proceeds of the sale after payment to the Option Holder of an amount equal to the Subscription Price and all applicable taxes (the Delayed Option Holder Profit), shall be placed in a fund which is deemed to be the Option Holder's property but administered by the Company or their duly appointed agents, to be released to the Option Holder according to the following schedule, provided the Option Holder does not have a Voluntarily Termination of their employment:
   - 1 month after completion of the Sale: 25% of the Delayed Option Holder Profit.

    (b) when an employee's employment is terminated as a result of serious breach of contract or gross negligence in the course of their duties, as determined following a proper disciplinary procedure, except where a finding of unfair dismissal is subsequently upheld.
