Template Employee Stock Option Files
====================

This repo shares template copies of the doocuments we used to setup our employee stock option scheme.
I cannot vouch for their fitness for other people to use. Any use is at your own risk.

The files in this pack are:

1. A [slide presentation](presentation/index.html) explaining about share options. This was sent to our employees.
2. The company articles, which allow the share-holders to create share-pools where pre-emption does not apply.
3. A shareholder resolution creating an employee share pool. 
4. A board motion authorising the use of that share pool.
5. A template contract, as sent to employees.
