Template Employee Stock Option Files
====================================

This repo shares template copies of the doocuments we used to setup our employee stock option scheme.
I cannot vouch for their fitness for other people to use. Any use is at your own risk.

The files in this pack are:

1. A slide presentation explaining about share options -- the file presentation/index.html, which you can view online [here](http://winterwell.com/company/slides/options.html). This was sent to our employees.
2. The company articles. The relevant articles are those allowing the share-holders to create share-pools where pre-emption does not apply, and the tag-along and drag-along articles.
3. A shareholder resolution creating an employee share pool. 
4. A board motion authorising the use of that share pool.
5. A template options contract, as sent to employees.

These files were .doc at one point, but being a tech company we put everything into tech-friendly text formats: .md is Markdown, which is almost plain-text, and the slides use the excellent Reveal.js system.
