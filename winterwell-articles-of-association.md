## 0. Objective of the Company

Winterwell Associates Ltd (hereinafter referred to as "the Company") is
incorporated with the principal aim of delivering value for the stakeholders --
including delivering high financial returns to the shareholders -- in a fair and
morally acceptable fashion. This aim is more properly defined in the clauses
below.

## 1. Model articles to apply

"Model Articles" refers to the current default model articles as in force at 17th July 2014
for a private company limited by shares as set out by the government. The Model Articles shall
apply to the Company except where excluded or varied hereby or inconsistent
herewith.

## 2. Appointment of Directors

Directors shall only be appointed in accordance with the following clauses.

1. There are two classes of director: Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors. 

2. The directors may appoint or remove Non-Executive Directors by passing a resolution at a Directors Meeting.

3. At each Annual General Meeting there shall be 
an Election of Directors, where Executive Directors representing shareholders
are elected to serve until the next Annual General Meeting, where they may be re-elected. 

4. Any shareholder or group of shareholders holding 5% or more of the issued and paid for voting share capital may nominate candidates to be an Executive Director. Currently serving Directors may be nominated at the Annual General Meeting. New candidates must be nominated at least one month in advance of the Annual General Meeting by writing to the Company Secretary. All such nominations will be distributed by the Company to all shareholders.

5. The vote to elect Executive Directors is carried out at the Annual General Meeting. 
Voting and counting are public. Each issued and paid for Ordinary share provides one vote. A shareholder may divide their votes between several nominated candidates.

6. Any nominated candidate receiving 15% or more of the votes shall be appointed to the Board as an Executive Director representing those shares. The percentage of votes they received shall be recorded for use in polls at director's meetings as set out in the Meetings Article.

7. One Executive Director may be appointed by the staff in a ballot 
carried out in advance of the Annual General Meeting and shall serve 
until the next Annual General Meeting. The ballot is to be organised by 
the board. All staff are entitled to vote, and each staff member has 
one vote. Existing members of the board are eligible to stand as 
candidates. In the event of a tie, the winner will be selected by 
random ballot.

8. To be appointed as a Director the candidate must be willing to serve 
as a Director and legally eligible under Scottish law.

9. Before attending any Directors Meetings, a nominated director must sign a service contract accepting the appointment and 
   reflecting their duties as set out in the Company's Articles of Association.
   This contract will be drawn up by the Company. If the nominated director does
   not sign the contract, then the board may choose not to appoint them. This
   clause overrules the rights given in the clauses above.

## 3. Removal of Directors

1. A director may be removed if they resign by notifying the other directors and sending
   a written notice to the Company's registered address.

2. An Executive Director may be removed by a board resolution if:
	1. they are found to be in breach of contract following a fair disciplinary
   process; or
	2. if they are found to have a broad conflict of interest which makes their
   presence on the board an unacceptable liability; or
	3. they are no longer able to serve as a Director, either for legal reasons or
   for health reasons, as set out in the Model Articles.

3. A Non-Executive Director may be removed by a board resolution at the board's discretion.

4. An Executive Director is removed if their term of service, as set out in the Appointment of Directors Articles, comes to an end and they are not re-appointed.

## 4. Directors duties


### 4.1 Fiduciary duties

Directors shall owe to the Company the standard fiduciary duties and any duties set out in the Model Articles.

### 4.2 Engagement

1. Executive Directors must actively engage with the Company. They are
   responsible for attending Directors Meetings and keeping up to date with the
   Company operations that are appropriate to their role.

2. Except where agreed otherwise, Non-Executive Directors have no obligations
   beyond those of articles 4.1 (fiduciary duties), 4.3 (honesty), and 4.5 (conflict of interest).

### 4.3 Honesty

In affairs relating to the company, all Directors must deal honestly with each
other, with all company workers, and with the outside world.

### 4.4 Responsibility

Executive Directors shall act in the interests of: the shareholders as a whole, the
employees, the company clients, the community, and the environment (hereinafter
"the Stakeholders"). Where these are in conflict, directors must at least take
all interests into account.

### 4.5 Conflict of interest

1. All Directors have a duty to avoid conflicts of interest and to notify the board of any potential conflict of
   interest. Failure to do so is considered a serious breach of duty to the
   Company.

2. Conflicts of interest include (but are not limited to): 
	- Competitive work and potential competitive work.
	- Where a decision will materially affect the director in a manner which is outside the normal course of their duties for the Company.
	- Personnel decisions involving close friends and family.

3. If there is a conflict of interest on an issue, the affected director(s)
   shall be excluded from discussions and/or votes regarding the issue unless
   the board votes to include them by an "Inclusion Vote". Inclusion Votes are
   held immediately by show of hands. All Executive Directors represented at the
   meeting may vote in an Inclusion Vote, including the affected directors, but
   the vote requires 75% or more of votes cast to be in favour of inclusion to
   pass.

4. If a conflict of interest is discovered at a later date, then resolutions
   passed at previous directors meetings shall stand (i.e. historical votes from
   previous meetings will not be recounted).

## 5. Transfer of shares

No shares may be transferred except in accordance with the clauses below. Any
transfer that is not carried out in agreement with these clauses may be deemed
invalid at the board's discretion. The board can refuse at their discretion to
register any such transfer.

### 5.1 Approved transfer

1. If a shareholder or their duly appointed representative wishes to transfer
shares and the board approves of the transfer, then the directors may register
the transfer immediately.

### 5.2 Pre-emption rights on the transfer of shares

1. If a shareholder or their duly appointed representative wishes to transfer
   shares (hereinafter referred to as "the transferor"), they must first notify
   the directors of the number they wish to transfer (this is the "transfer
   notice").

2. The Board of Directors shall have 2 months from receipt of the transfer
   notice in which to nominate a buyer or buyers and offer a price to the
   transferor, which may include a delayed payment scheme of up to 6 months. If
   the buyer(s) and the transferor agree on the price then this shall be binding
   on all parties. The transfer shall not be registered until the full price has
   been paid.

3. If the transferor chooses not to accept the Board of Director's offer, or if
   no such offer is made, and provided at least two months have elapsed from
   receipt of the transfer notice, then the transferor may sell the shares to
   any party, provided the price is greater than that offered by the directors.

### 5.3 Permitted Transfer 

1. A Permitted Transferee is:
  - in relation to a Shareholder who is an individual, any of their Close Relations, 
  or the trustee(s) of a Family Trust, or from one Founder to another Founder; or
  - in relation to a Shareholder which is a company, a Member of the Same Group as 
  that company.

2. A Shareholder (the Original Shareholder) may transfer all or any of their  
Shares to a Permitted Transferee. Where Shares are held by the trustee(s) of a 
Family Trust, the trustee(s) may 
transfer Shares to: (a) the Original Shareholder; (b) any Close Relation(s) of 
the Original Shareholder; (c) subject to Article 5.3.3, the trustee(s) of 
another Family Trust of which the Original Shareholder is the Settlor; or
(d) subject to Article 5.3.3, to the new (or remaining) trustee(s) upon a
change of trustee(s) of a Family Trust, 
without any price or other restriction.

3. A transfer of Shares may only be made to the trustee(s) 
of a Family Trust if the Directors are satisfied:   
 - (a) with the terms of the trust instrument and, in particular, with 
the powers of the trustee(s);   
 - (b) with the identity of the proposed trustee(s);   
 - (c) that the proposed transfer will not result in 50% or more of the 
aggregate of the Company's equity share capital being held by trustees of that and any other trusts; and   
 - (d) that no costs incurred in connection with the setting up or administration 
of that Family Trust are to be paid by the Company.

4. If the Original Shareholder is a company, and a Permitted Transfer 
has been made, the Permitted Transferee shall, within 20 Business Days of 
ceasing to be a Member of the Same Group as the Original Shareholder, 
transfer the Shares held by it to:    
 - (a) the Original Shareholder; or   
 - (b) a Member of the Same Group as the Original Shareholder, (which in either case is not in liquidation), without any price or other restriction.     
If the Permitted Transferee fails to make a transfer in accordance with 
this article, a Transfer Notice shall be deemed to have been given in respect of such Shares on the 
expiry of the period set out in this article.

5. If the Original Shareholder is an individual and a Permitted Transfer has
   been made to a Close Relation of the Original Shareholder, the Permitted
   Transferee (or the transmittee(s) of any such person), shall within 20
   Business Days of ceasing to be a Close Relation of the Original Shareholder
   (whether by reason of divorce or otherwise) either: 
    - (a) execute and deliver to the Company a transfer of the Shares held by him to the Original
   Shareholder (or to any Permitted Transferee of the Original Shareholder) for
   such consideration as may be agreed between them;   
    - or (b) give a Transfer Notice to the Company, failing which a Transfer Notice shall be deemed to have been given in respect of such Shares on the
   expiry of the period set out in this article.    
   This article shall not apply to a transmittee of a Permitted Transferee if that
   transmittee is also a Permitted Transferee of the Original Shareholder, to
   the extent that such transmittee is legally or beneficially entitled to those
   Shares.


### 5.4 Tag Along Article

1. In the event that a proposed transfer of Shares (other than a transfer of 
Shares to a Permitted Transferee), whether made as one or as a series of 
transactions (a Proposed Transfer) would, if completed, result in any 
person (the Buyer) other than the Founders, acquiring a Controlling Interest 
in the Company, the remaining provisions of this Tag Along Article shall apply.

2. The Seller(s) shall procure that, prior to the completion of the Proposed Transfer, the Buyer shall make an offer (the Offer) to each Shareholder on the date of the Offer to buy all of the Shares held by such Shareholders on the date of the Offer for a consideration (in cash and/or Liquid Securities) per Share (the Offer Price) which is equal to the highest price per Share offered, paid or to be paid by the Buyer, or any person acting in concert with the Buyer, for any Shares in connection with the Proposed Transfer or any transaction in the 12 calendar months preceding the date of completion of the Proposed Transfer.

3. The Offer shall be made by notice in writing (an Offer Notice) addressed to each Shareholder at least 10 Business Days (the Offer Period) before the date fixed for completion of the Proposed Transfer (the Sale Date). To the extent not described in any accompanying documents, the Offer Notice shall specify:   
 - (a) the identity of the Buyer (and any person(s) acting in concert with the Buyer);   
 - (b) the Offer Price and any other terms and conditions of the Offer;   
 - (c) the Sale Date; and   
 - (d) the number of Shares which would be held by the Buyer (and persons acting in concert with the Buyer) on completion of the Proposed Transfer.

4. The completion of the Proposed Transfer shall be conditional in all respects on:   
 - (a) the making of an Offer in accordance with this Tag Along Article; and   
 - (b) the completion of the transfer of any Shares by any Shareholder (each an Accepting Shareholder) who accepts the Offer within the Offer Period,
and the Directors shall refuse to register any Proposed Transfer made in breach of this Tag Along Article.

5. The Proposed Transfer is, but the purchase of Shares from Accepting Shareholders pursuant to an 
Offer made under this Tag Along Article shall not be, subject to the pre-emption provisions of Article 5.2.


### 5.5 Drag-along

1. If the holders of more than 50% of the Ordinary Shares in issue for the time being (the Selling Shareholders), provided that the total consideration that would be payable for all issued Shares by the Proposed Buyer (as defined below) is at least £5 million in cash, wish to transfer all of their interest in Shares (Sellers' Shares) to a bona fide arm's-length purchaser (Proposed Buyer), the Selling Shareholders shall have the option (Drag Along Option) to require all the other holders of Shares on the date of the request (Called Shareholders) to sell and transfer all their interest in Shares with full title guarantee to the Proposed Buyer (or as the Proposed Buyer may direct) in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

2. The Selling Shareholders may exercise the Drag Along Option by giving notice in writing to that effect (a Drag Along Notice), at any time before the completion of the transfer of the Sellers' Shares, to the Proposed Buyer, each Called Shareholder and to the board of Directors. A Drag Along Notice shall specify:   
(a) that the Called Shareholders are required to transfer all their Shares (Called Shares) pursuant to the Drag Along Article;   
(b) the identity of the Proposed Buyer (and, if relevant, the transferee(s) nominated by the Proposed Buyer);   
(c) the consideration payable for each of the Called Shares calculated in accordance with the Drag Along Article (Drag Along Price);   
(d) the proposed date of completion of transfer of the Called Shares.

3. Once given, a Drag Along Notice may not be revoked by the Selling Shareholders save with the prior consent of the Directors. However, a Drag Along Notice shall lapse if, for any reason, the Selling Shareholders have not completed the transfer of all the Sellers' Shares to the Proposed Buyer (or as the Proposed Buyer may direct) within 20 Business Days of serving the Drag Along Notice. The Selling Shareholders may serve further Drag Along Notices following the lapse of any particular Drag Along Notice, but not within 10 working days of such lapse.

4. The consideration for which the Called Shareholders shall be obliged to sell each of the Called Shares shall be the same as that proposed to be paid by the Proposed Buyer in respect of each of the Sellers' Shares.

5. No Drag Along Notice shall require a Called Shareholder to agree to any terms except those specifically set out in these Articles.

6. Completion of the sale and purchase of the Called Shares shall take place on the same date as, and conditionally upon the completion of, the sale and purchase of the Sellers' Shares unless:   
(a) all of the Called Shareholders and the Selling Shareholders otherwise agree; or   
(b) that date is less than 20 Business Days after the date of service of the Drag Along Notice, in which case completion of the sale and purchase of the Called Shares shall take place 20 Business Days after the date of service of the Drag Along Notice.

7. Within 20 Business Days of the Selling Shareholders serving a Drag Along Notice on the Called Shareholders, the Called Shareholders shall deliver stock transfer forms for their Shares in favour of the Proposed Buyer (or as the Proposed Buyer may direct), together with the share certificate(s) in respect of those Shares (or a suitable indemnity in respect thereof) to the Company.  On the expiration of that 20 Business Day period the Company shall pay the Called Shareholders, on behalf of the Proposed Buyer, the amounts they are respectively due if the Proposed Buyer has put the Company in the requisite funds.  The Company's receipt for the amounts due shall be a good discharge to the Proposed Buyer. The Company shall hold the amounts due to the Called Shareholders in trust for the Called Shareholders without any obligation to pay interest.

8. If the Proposed Buyer has not, on the expiration of the 20 Business Day period, put the Company in funds to pay the amounts due, the Called Shareholders shall be entitled to the return of the stock transfer forms and share certificate(s) (or suitable indemnity) for the relevant Shares and the Called Shareholders shall have no further rights or obligations in relation to any existing Drag Along Notice.

9. If any Called Shareholder fails to deliver to the Company a duly executed stock transfer form (or forms) in respect of the Called Shares held by him (together with the share certificate(s) in respect of those Called Shares (or a suitable indemnity in respect thereof)) the defaulting Called Shareholder shall be deemed to have appointed any person nominated for the purpose by the Selling Shareholders to be his agent and attorney to execute and deliver all necessary transfers on his behalf, against receipt by the Company (on trust for such holder) of the consideration payable for the Called Shares. After the Proposed Buyer (or person(s) nominated by the Proposed Buyer) has been registered as the holder of any such Called Shares, the validity of such proceedings shall not be questioned by any person. Failure to produce a share certificate shall not impede the registration of any transfer of Shares under this Drag Along Article.

10. Upon any person, following the issue of a Drag Along Notice, becoming a Shareholder (or increasing an existing shareholding) including, without limitation, pursuant to the exercise of any option, warrant or other right to acquire or subscribe for, or to convert any security into, Shares, whether or not pursuant to a Share Pool (a New Shareholder), a Drag Along Notice shall be deemed to have been served upon the New Shareholder, on the same terms as the previous Drag Along Notice, who shall then be bound to sell and transfer all such Shares acquired by him to the Proposed Buyer (or as the Proposed Buyer may direct) and the provisions of this Drag Along Article shall apply mutatis mutandis to the New Shareholder, save that completion of the sale of such Shares shall take place forthwith upon the later of the Drag Along Notice being deemed served on the New Shareholder and the date of completion of the sale of the Called Shares.

11. A transfer of Called Shares to a Proposed Buyer (or as the Proposed Buyer may direct) pursuant to a sale in respect of which a Drag Along Notice has been duly served shall not be subject to the pre-emption provisions of Article 5.2.  

12. Any Transfer Notice or Deemed Transfer Notice served in respect of the transfer of any Share which has not completed before the date of service of a Drag Along Notice shall automatically be revoked by the service of a Drag Along Notice.


## 6. Issue of Shares

"Relevant Securities" are defined to be any Shares or other securities convertible into, or carrying the right to subscribe for Shares, issued by the Company after the Adoption Date, other than:    
(a) the grant of any options under a Share Pool (and the issue of Shares on the exercise of any such options); and
(b) any Shares or other securities issued in consideration of the acquisition by the Company of any company or business.

### 6.1 Pre-emption rights on the issue of further shares

1. If the Company proposes to issue any Relevant Securities, except where issued as part of a Share Pool in accordance with clause 6.2, those Relevant Securities shall not be allotted to any person unless the Company has first offered them to the holders (on the date of the offer) of the Shares (each an Offeree) on a pari passu basis and in the respective proportions that the number of Shares held by each such holder bears to the total number of Shares held by all such holders (as nearly as possible without involving fractions) and on the same terms, and at the same price, as those Relevant Securities are being, or are to be, offered to any other person.

2. An offer made under Article 6.1 shall:   
    - (a) be in writing and give details of the number, class and subscription price (including any share premium) of the Relevant Securities being offered;
   - (b) remain open for a period of at least 20 Business Days from the date of service of the offer; and
   - (c) stipulate that any Offeree who wishes to subscribe for a number of Relevant Securities in excess of the number to which he is entitled under Article 6.1 shall, in his acceptance, state the number of excess Relevant Securities (Excess Securities) for which he wishes to subscribe.

3. If, on the expiry of an offer made under Article 6.1, the total number of Relevant Securities applied for is less or equal to than the total number of Relevant Securities so offered, the Directors shall allot the Relevant Securities to the Offerees in accordance with their applications.

4. Any Relevant Securities not accepted by Offerees pursuant to an offer made under Article 6.1 shall be used to satisfy any requests for Excess Securities made pursuant to Article (c). If there are insufficient Excess Securities to satisfy such requests, the Excess Securities shall be allotted to the applicants in the respective proportions that the number of Shares held by each such applicant bears to the total number of such Shares held by all applicants (as nearly as possible without involving fractions or increasing the number of Excess Securities allotted to any Shareholder beyond that applied for by him). 

5. If, after completion of the allotments referred to in Articles 6.1.3 and 6.1.4, not all of the Relevant Securities have been allotted, the balance of such Relevant Securities shall be offered to any other person(s) as the Directors may determine, at the same price and on the same terms as the offer to the Shareholders.

### 6.2 Issue of further shares

1. The shareholders may decide by Ordinary Resolution to issue shares subject to pre-emption rights as described in Article 6.1, and instruct such work as is necessary to enact the resolution. 
No shares shall be issued except in accordance with this Article 6.2 or with Article 6.3 regarding Share Pools.

### 6.3 Share Pools and Directors powers to issue shares

1. The shareholders may decide by Special Resolution to create Share Pools 
which govern the issue of shares of a designated share class and upto a maximum total allocation for the 
Share Pool, and set such conditions as they see fit on how shares for that Share Pool may be issued, and
such Share Pools shall not be subject to pre-emption rights. 

2. The Board shall then be entitled to and enter into contracts regarding shares, issue shares, and 
allocate shares for the Share Pool upto the maximum total allocation, subject to any additional terms 
and conditions as the Directors think proper, provided this is in accordance with the conditions of 
the Share Pool.

3. The shareholders may revoke any authority granted under Article 6.2 by ordinary resolution, 
but such loss of authority shall not affect the issue of shares or contracts to issue shares legitimately 
entered into by the Board under Article 6.3 before the authority was revoked.


## 7. Shares

1. Except as required by law or these articles, the Company is not bound by or
   compelled to recognise (even when having notice) any equitable, contingent,
   optional or future interest in any share or any fractional part of a share.

2. A shareholder may assign the voting rights associated with some or all of
   their shares to any party, either temporarily or permanently, and such party
   shall be considered to act as and for the shareholder in company meetings and
   polls.

3. The Company has two classes of share with the following rights:    
   - Ordinary Shares, which have voting rights where each share carries one vote in any shareholders vote.
   - Ordinary A Shares, which do not have voting rights but otherwise rank equally with Ordinary Shares.

## 8. Meetings

### 8.1 Notice

1. Directors Meetings (also referred to as board meetings) may be called by any two directors ("the conveners"). 

2. Directors Meetings may be called instantly if all the directors
   agree. Otherwise, Directors Meetings require at least 2 weeks notice.
   All directors must be notified of the meeting.

3. Shareholder Meetings may be called by a resolution at a Directors
   Meeting, or by shareholders representing 40% or more of the issued voting
   shares. There must be at least one Shareholder meeting per year ("the Annual
   General Meeting").

4. Shareholder Meetings may be called instantly if shareholders
   representing 75% or more of the issued shares agree. Otherwise,
   shareholder meetings require at least one month's notice. All shareholders
   and all directors must be notified of the meeting.

3. Notice of meetings may be issued by email or in writing. The notice
   shall specify the time and place of the meeting and the general
   nature of the business to be transacted. Proof of receipt of the
   notice is not necessary provided it was sent with the reasonable
   assumption that it would be received at least 1 week before the
   meeting.

4. Meeting times and places must be chosen in good faith. The conveners
   must take reasonable care to ensure that the meeting is as accessible as possible
   to those who are entitled to attend.
   

### 8.2 Attendance and Quorum

1. All directors are entitled to attend and speak at Directors Meetings. All
   shareholders and all directors are entitled to attend and speak at Shareholder
   Meetings.

2. Any person entitled to attend a meeting may instead send a representative in
   their place, provided they provide the other attendees with details of the
   representative's authority to act on their behalf (e.g. a signed letter).
   This representative shall be entitled to speak and vote on behalf of the
   member.

3. Any person or person's proxy or duly authorised representative may
   participate in a meeting by means of conference telephone or similar
   communications system provided all those participating in the meeting can
   hear and address each other. Such participation shall be deemed to constitute
   presence in person (or by proxy or authorised representative as appropriate)
   at such meeting for all purposes, including that of establishing a quorum. A
   meeting held by such means shall be deemed to take place where the largest
   group of participators in number is assembled. In the absence of such a
   majority the location of the chairman shall be deemed to be the place of the
   meeting.

4. A Quorum for a Directors Meeting is 2 directors or 50% of the directors
   (rounding down), whichever is greater. If attendance falls below the Quorum
   level then the meeting shall be deemed to be adjourned.

5. A Quorum for a Shareholders Meeting is shareholders or their proxies or representatives 
representing 50% of the issued voting share capital.

6. If a meeting does not reach Quorum within one hour of the designated
   starting time, or if it falls below Quorum at any point after starting (excluding during comfort breaks), the meeting shall be adjourned.

7. Any member may request a companion (i.e. someone who would not
   otherwise be entitled to attend) to accompany them in a meeting or
   for part of a meeting for the purpose of providing support and
   advice. This request may be made in advance or on the day. The chair
   for that meeting shall decide which sections of the meeting the
   companion may attend, but must give reasons for their decision. In
   general, companions should be admitted unless their presence poses a
   risk to the Company's interests (e.g. due to sensitive matters) or is
   likely to be disruptive.
      
   Companions will be listed as "in attendance" rather than "present" in the
   minutes and are not counted in unanimous statements. Companions do not have
   the right to address the meeting unless the chair allows it. Members may
   request short (e.g. 5-10 minute) breaks to consult privately with companions.

### 8.3 Chair

The chair for a meeting shall be decided when the meeting is called. The chair
shall be the company chair if expected to attend. Otherwise, the chair shall be
chosen randomly from those expected to attend and willing to chair.

If the designated chair does not arrive within 15 minutes of the designated
starting time, the delegates present may elect a chair.

The chair is responsible for running the meeting, such that:

 - The agenda is covered.
 - All present who are entitled to address the meeting are given fair chance to express their views.
 - Resolutions are passed in a clear manner.

### 8.4 Resolutions and Polls

1. Resolutions can only be passed at Directors Meetings and Shareholder Meetings
when a Quorum is present. 

2. Resolutions passed at a Shareholders Meeting (a "Shareholder
   Resolution") take precedence over resolutions passed at Directors
   Meetings ("Directors Resolutions"). Where a Directors Resolution is
   inconsistent with a Shareholder Resolution, the Directors Resolution
   shall be considered invalid. 

3. Resolutions are passed either by unanimous show of hands or by a poll. Any
   member may request a poll either before the result is declared or when the
   result is declared.

4. Polls may be carried out immediately. However if a poll is
   requested, any member who is present and entitled to vote may demand a
   "cooling off" period of upto 2 weeks before the poll is carried out.
   The chair of the meeting shall set the date for the poll and
   supervise its execution.

5. If the poll is not carried out immediately, then
   notice of the poll must be given to all members entitled to vote, and this
   notice must be sent out as soon as is pragmatically possible.

6. Polls may be carried out by written voting or by email. A poll may be
   carried out within a Directors Meeting by collecting signed votes from those
   present. Votes are not secret, and any member entitled to vote in a poll may
   request to know how the other members voted.

7. In a Shareholder Meeting, members have as many votes in a poll as they have shares with voting rights. 

8. In a poll at a Directors Meeting:
    - Each Executive Director representing shareholders shall have 1 vote for every 1% of 
	the votes they received (rounding to the nearest whole number) during the Election of Directors 
	by the shareholders (see Appointment of Directors Article).
    - The Executive Director appointed by the staff shall have 10 votes. If this director is also 
    an Executive Director representing shareholders, then these votes are additional votes.
    - Non-Executive Directors do not vote.

10. In a Directors Meeting, directors may be excluded from voting due to a
   conflict of interest (see Director's Duties Article). This does not apply in
   shareholder meetings.

11. In order for an ordinary resolution to be passed, it must receive over 50%
of the votes cast. An exception to this is that ordinary resolutions can be
passed via the Deadlock process described in Article 8.5.

12. In order for a special resolution to be passed, it must receive over 70% of
the votes cast, and over 50% of the maximum possible votes (i.e. abstentions and
absent voters are counted with votes against for calculating the 50%
threshold). An exception to this is that special resolutions can be passed via
the Deadlock process described in Article 8.5.

13. Changes requiring a special resolution include (but are not limited to)
altering the company's memorandum and articles, allowing the company to purchase
its own shares, selling or winding up the company.


### 8.5 Deadlock

1. Deadlock is defined to occur when: 
	- There is an issue under dispute,
	- and one or more resolutions have been proposed to resolve the issue, 
	- and all members entitled to vote have been notified of the dispute and had a chance to vote on it at a suitable Shareholders Meeting,
	- and none of the resolutions to resolve the issue can be passed, 
	- and there is a reasonable business reason to take a decision,
	- and a Poll of shareholders has been taken to declare Deadlock with 50% or 
	more of the votes cast in favour of declaring Deadlock. 

2. In the event of Deadlock as defined above, the various parties in the
   dispute shall attempt to reach an agreement through mediation conducted in
   good faith, that is with an earnest attempt to find a workable compromise.
   Mediation shall last either (a) until all parties declare it to be over, or
   (b) for at least two weeks, after which any party in the dispute may declare mediation to be over.
	
3. If mediation should fail to find an acceptable compromise, the issue
   will be resolved by random selection. Each member entitled to vote may
   submit a resolution to the Company for the Selection, provided that resolution is a
   legitimate and proportionate response to the issue at stake. That is, a member may not
   submit a resolution for the Selection that is out of proportion to the original issue,
   or involves an unwarranted extension of the issue, or is on a
   different topic. 

4. If random Selection is applied, the chair shall first circulate all 
	resolutions as submitted to the Company, and then call an extraordinary general
	meeting of shareholders. A neutral independent Temporary Chair shall be selected to run
	this meeting by writing to a suitable trade body and requesting recommendations. 
	Final resolutions shall be entered into the Selection at
	this meeting. Resolutions may be edited or rejected if they are
	not a legitimate and proportionate response to the issue at stake. 
	Any member may propose such edits or rejections, and the decision shall be made by the Temporary Chair.
   
5. Once all resolutions for random Selection have been accepted into
   the Selection (possibly with edits as described in Article 8.5.4 above), one
   resolution shall be picked from the Selection at random with weights
   set according to voting shares of the shareholders who support it. That is, the probability of a
   resolution being picked must be proportional to the paid for voting shares
   held by the member(s) who support it. The selected resolution shall
   be recorded as having been passed by the board via the deadlock
   process. This rule takes precedence over the normal rules for Polls
   and decisions set out in Article 8.4.

6. All parties will accept the result of the random Selection and resulting
   decision. A counter-resolution may not be brought to the board for at
 least 3 months.

7. Deadlock may not be used to harm any stakeholder's legal rights. If
   during the mediation period there is reasonable doubt regarding the
   legality of an action, then an independent legal opinion on this
   issue shall be consulted. A neutral lawyer shall be selected by
   writing to a suitable trade body and requesting recommendations. All
   parties shall meet once with the neutral lawyer to present their
   case, unless they waive this right or forfeit it through delay of
   more than one week.

   The Company shall pay for the expenses associated with this. Any
   subsequent meetings with the neutral lawyer must be at the lawyer's
   written request and may be at the member's expense.

   The neutral lawyer's decision shall then be final and binding. To
   prevent obstruction, each shareholder may only invoke this clause
   at most once within a given Deadlock.

## 9. Ethical policy: Do no harm

1. The Company will not engage in any project if the directors believe the
   overall effects are likely to be "Harmful" which is defined as "significantly
   harmful to either society, the environment or the rights of the individual".
   What is significant is left to the judgement of the directors, except that it
   explicitly does not require 'of global significance' or 'of national
   significance'.

2. If the directors decide that an existing contract is likely to be Harmful
   (as defined above), the Company will attempt to negotiate a reasonable exit
   from that contract. If an exit would be particularly detrimental to the
   Company's interests, the directors may choose to complete the contract but
   not to renew or extend it.

3. Any director may call for a discussion on the ethics of any Company project,
   either proposed or ongoing. These discussions will consider only the ethics
   of the project in question. The ethics of other projects carried out by
   partners in the project under discussion are explicitly excluded (this
   includes hypothetical benefits from hypothetical projects). If an ethical
   discussion is called, the directors must vote that the project is not
   harmful, as defined above. I.e. there must be a resolution in favour of the
   project for it to go ahead.

4. If a project is considered Harmful, it may be amended to include a positive
   offset (e.g. as with carbon offsetting) in order to make the overall effects
   not Harmful.

## 10. Confidential information

1. The Company aims to be open in its dealings with all stakeholders, and also to
respect their privacy.

2. "Private Data" is defined to be client data or personal data collected from members of the public. 
Where the Company holds Private Data it shall:   
 - Take reasonable steps to protect confidentiality.
 - Provide the supplier of the data and the subjects of the data with such rights as seem reasonable, as determined by the Company. 

## 11. Waiver

1. All of the above clauses form part of the basis for Winterwell Associates. The
failure by any party to enforce at any time or for any period any one or more of
the clauses set out here shall not be a waiver of them or of the right at any
time subsequently to enforce all terms and conditions of this agreement.

2. If any of the clauses are found to contravene the law, then the articles shall
be amended in the smallest manner and so as to preserve the spirit of the original clauses as far as is legally valid.
