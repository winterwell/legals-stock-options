## SoDash: Everybody has a share ##
					
 - Winterwell/SoDash is jointly owned by lots of people: the founders, the investors, and the staff.
 - **Everyone who works here can own a part of the business.** If the company is successful, we will all make money.
 - Each year, around the company Annual General Meeting (AGM), a block of shares are released for the staff.
 - You will get issued share options.
 - What if you work for The Sandpit? 
    - You do have to be a SoDash employee to get share options...    
    - ...But the plan is to transfer jobs and staff contracts to SoDash.
    - We will recognise time spent as a dedicated SoDash worker, even if not an employee.

## SoDash: Everybody has a Say ##

 - SoDash is run by lots of people: the investors, the management, and the staff.
 - **Everyone who works here has a say.**
 - The Shareholders appoint the Board of Directors to make decisions.
 - Each year, around the company Annual General Meeting (AGM), the staff elect someone to sit on the Board.   
 - Any staff member can stand for election.
   - Although there is no extra pay or perks.
 - Everyone gets a vote.
 - The current staff-appointed director is Alex Nuttgens.
</section>

<section data-markdown class='crowded'>
## So what’s all this about share options, then? ##

 - SoDash offers its staff *share options*.
 - An option is the right to buy a share (i.e. a piece of) a company at a fixed price. 
   - You are initially *granted* the option subject so some T&Cs, notably staying with SoDash.
   - If you then choose to buy the share, this is called *exercising* the option.
 - Because it’s a right to buy, you don’t have to buy it. 
 - You generally exercise options and sell your shares at the same time: when the company exits -- someone buys the whole company, or we go public on the stock market (an IPO). 
Then you exercisie the option (and receive the shares) and simultaneously sell the shares, and get the money.
</section>

<section data-markdown class='crowded'>
## How options work, under the hood… ##

 - Your options have an *exercise price* (aka *strike price*), which is set when the option is granted.
 - Because a share is a part of the company, the price is based on the company value – but using a pessimistic view of that (because a low exercise price = a larger gain). This is the price you can buy the shares at.
 - Because the value of an option doesn’t ‘crystallise’ until it is exercised, you don’t incur any taxable gain until you exercise them.
<!-- - In our case, options are issued on ordinary shares in the Company. This is the same kind of shares as all the management (including the founders) hold.
Technically, it's ordinary A which is the same without voting.
 -->
 - Once your options have vested, you can choose when (and if) to exercise them – paying the exercise price to buy the shares.
 - *If we sell SoDash, we have to sell all the shares. So no other employees, managers or founders are able to take money out of the company until you have.*   
   - That was a requirement of our founding team — so **we’re all in the same boat!**
</section>

<section data-markdown class='crowded'>
## Vesting schedules explained ##

- You don’t create value in a start-up company all at once, but over time.
 - To reflect that, your options vest over time – that is to say, you can't use them straight away. You have to keep working for SoDash, building the company toward a successful exit.
 - Your options take **three years** before they vest and can be exercised.
   - If you have been with SoDash a while, we will take that into account with a shorter vesting period.
   - You get issued extra options each year – each set of options takes 3 years from when they are issued to vest.
   - To maximise your gain (because we have a low exercise price just now), we will pre-issue some of these future shares now, but with a longer vesting period.
 - OR if we successfully sell the company, you get accelerated vesting:
   - 50% of your options will vest instantly. Hurrah!
   - The other 50% will vest monthly over 6 months, so you get a payout each month for 6 months. This creates a transition period (so we don't all sail off on our shiny new yachts the next day, leaving the buyer with a ghost company).
   - You are protected: If the acquirer were to let some staff go, they would still get all their options.

## Death and taxes... ##

 - Unfortunately, none of us can escape taxation, and *you may want to get your own tax advice (we cannot provide any).*
 - Our options are issued within a government approved scheme for keeping taxes as low as possible for employee options. It's called an EMI approved scheme.
 - In practice this means that when we want to issue options, we first agree a valuation with HMRC (the tax authorities). This sets your exercise price.
 - You will not have to pay any tax when your options are granted.
 - You will only have pay to pay tax when (and if) the option is exercised, at which point you will pay capital gains tax on the difference between the exercise price of the option and the value of each share. But the EMI scheme gives you a reduced tax rate (18%).
 - Good news: if you exercise your option on exit, this is precisely the moment when you will receive the money, so paying the tax is not a problem.

## Shares: What happens now? ##

 - We have asked the accountants to agree a valuation with HMRC.
 - At Annual General Meeting (AGM) you will receive a letter with a pack of documents.
   - Including: an option certificate which sets out what you receive and the vesting schedule,
the scheme rules with all the small print about the grant.
   - There will be some forms for you to read and sign.
